    """
    Simple demo for a scenario where we have direct observations (ie ratings
    or responses) with noise.  The model has three parameters, but after
    initial training, we fix one to be 1.0 and optimize the other two.  At
    each step, we visualize the posterior mean, variance and expected
    improvement.  We then find the point of maximum expected improvement and
    ask the user for the scalar response value.  
    
    To see how the model adapts to inputs, try rating the first few values 
    higher or lower than predicted and see what happens to the visualizations.
